I am a transfer student from Manor College, a private two-year Catholic college in Jenkintown, Pa. It was a fantastic school with a fantastic staff. Right before I completed my time at Manor, I decided it would be good to transfer and get my bachelor's degree. Manor has an agreement with Chestnut Hill College, so all of my credits transferred over to whichever major I chose. I chose political science, after previously being a paralegal major at Manor, and began my journey in August. 

I was incredibly nervous about transferring at first, but the process was quick and easy. The staff here at CHC has been spectacular in helping me. I've adjusted to my classes, made plenty of friends and have joined clubs and extracurricular activities. So let me put to rest some concerns some students might have about transferring to CHC.
